# Mission Moon Data Analysis - Power BI Project

## Overview
This project, **Mission Moon Data Analysis**, is a comprehensive analysis of moon landing missions using **Power BI**. The project provides key insights into various moon missions conducted by different space organizations, their success rates, mission timelines, and other critical data points.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes information on:
- Mission names
- Launch dates
- Space agencies involved
- Mission success status
- Launch locations
- Rocket types and models

## Insights & Findings
From analyzing the dataset, the following key insights were derived:
1. **Total Missions**: The number of moon missions launched so far.
2. **Success vs. Failure Rate**: A breakdown of successful, failed, and ongoing missions.
3. **Country-wise Contributions**: Identifying which countries have conducted the most moon missions.
4. **Top Space Agencies**: NASA, Roscosmos, ISRO, and others - their involvement and success rates.
5. **Mission Trends Over Time**: How the number of missions has changed over decades.
6. **Rocket Usage**: The most frequently used rocket types for moon missions.
7. **Future Missions**: Planned missions and their expected launch years.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard presents interactive visualizations including:
- A timeline of moon missions.
- A bar chart of missions by country.
- A pie chart showing mission success vs. failure rates.
- A map visualization indicating launch locations.
- Rocket-wise mission analysis.

## How to Use
1. Download the `.pbix` file and open it using **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**.
2. Explore the interactive dashboard to gain insights.
3. Filter data based on your interests, such as specific agencies or time periods.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** for data visualization.
- **CSV dataset** for data source.
- **DAX & Power Query** for data transformation.

## Future Improvements
- Adding real-time data updates from space agencies.
- Enhancing the dashboard with more detailed mission breakdowns.
- Incorporating predictive analysis for future moon missions.
